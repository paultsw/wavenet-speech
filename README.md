WaveNet-Speech
==============

Implementation of Google Deepmind's WaveNet for speech recognition, written in PyTorch.

See section 3.4 of the paper [WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio (PDF)](`https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf) for more details on how the speech recognition setup differs from the standard WaveNet architecture.
